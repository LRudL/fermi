      "Running search engines with generative AI could increase the electricity needed to power people‚Äôs regular Internet use. According to an industry analyst, a single generative AI query could use 4 to 5 times more energy than a regular search engine query. Others found that average energy consumption per search could be 6.9‚Äì8.9 Wh, compared to 0.3 Wh for a standard Google search. Research and consulting firm SemiAnalysis estimates that integrating generative AI into search engines like Google, which runs up to nine billion searches per day, could lead to a daily electricity consumption of 80 GWh and an annual consumption of 29.2 TWh, equivalent to what about 2.7 million average U.S. households use in a year. A worst-case scenario in which Google‚Äôs search engine ran entirely on AI could consume as much electricity as Ireland.\n",

The model is available in several versions, with higher versions usually producing better image quality. stable-diffusion-v1-4 is the latest version, having been trained for 225,000 steps at 512x512 resolution on a filtered subset of the LAION-5B dataset with improved aesthetics. This version also uses 10% text conditioning dropout to improve classifier-free guidance sampling. Model inputs and outputs Stable Diffusion takes a text prompt as input and generates a corresponding photo-realistic image as output.

The model is initialized from a previous version, Stable Diffusion v1.2, and fine-tuned on a substantial dataset, the LAION-Aesthetics v2 5+, for 225,000 steps at a resolution of 512x512 ([Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4)).\n",

      "\u001b[32mStable Diffusion v1.4 was trained using a robust hardware setup, involving 32 x 8 A100 GPUs, with gradient accumulations set to 2 and a batch size of 2048 ([Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4)). This indicates that the model is computationally intensive, which is consistent with models having a high number of parameters. The extensive hardware requirements suggest that the model's architecture is complex and resource-demanding.\n",

This inference is based on the model's complexity, training setup, and performance capabilities. Understanding these aspects is crucial for researchers and practitioners who aim to utilize or further develop such models.\n",

      "\u001b[32m## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[32mData centres are crucial components of the digital infrastructure, supporting a wide array of services from cloud computing to data storage. However, their energy consumption and associated carbon emissions have raised significant environmental concerns. This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from data centres in the United Kingdom for the year 2023, based on the most relevant and reliable data available.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[32m## Energy Consumption and Emissions Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[32mIn 2023, data centres globally consumed approximately 7.4 gigawatts of power, marking a 55% increase from the previous year ([Brightlio](https://brightlio.com/data-center-stats/)). This surge in energy consumption is reflective of the growing demand for digital services and the expansion of data centre infrastructure. Within this context, the UK, which houses 517 data centres, is a significant player in the global data centre market ([Brightlio](https://brightlio.com/data-center-stats/)).\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[32m## CO2 Emissions from UK Data Centres\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[32mThe carbon emissions from data centres are primarily attributed to their substantial electricity consumption. Data centres are reported to account for between 1% and 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions ([Channel News Asia](https://brightlio.com/data-center-stats/)). While specific data for the UK is not explicitly detailed in the provided sources, extrapolating from global trends and the UK's share in the data centre market can offer insights.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[32m### Estimations and Comparisons\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[32mGiven that the UK ranks among the top countries with the most data centres, it is reasonable to infer that its data centres contribute significantly to national CO2 emissions. For instance, PubMatic's UK operations reported emitting 321 tonnes of carbon, equating to the electricity consumption of 41 homes annually ([PubMatic](https://pubmatic.com/blog/pubmatics-uk-carbon-footprint-report-highlights-carbon-efficient-operations-provides-a-blueprint-for-future-efforts/)). This example underscores the potential scale of emissions when considering the entire sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[32mFurthermore, the discrepancy between reported emissions and location-based emissions highlights the potential underreporting of data centre emissions. For example, Meta's location-based emissions for data centres were reported to be over 19,000 times higher than their official figures ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/sep/15/data-center-gas-emissions-tech)). Such discrepancies suggest that the actual emissions from UK data centres could be significantly higher than officially reported figures.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[32m## Initiatives and Mitigation Efforts\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[32mTo address the environmental impact, several initiatives have been launched. The Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact, initiated in January 2021, aims to make data centres climate-neutral by 2030, with intermediate targets set for 2025 ([IEA](https://www.iea.org/energy-system/buildings/data-centres-and-data-transmission-networks)). This pact involves commitments to improve power usage effectiveness (PUE) and increase the use of carbon-free energy sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[32mAdditionally, the European Union's Code of Conduct for Data Centres encourages operators to adopt best practices to reduce energy consumption and promote sustainability ([Joint Research Centre](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/jrc-news-and-updates/eu-code-conduct-data-centres-towards-more-innovative-sustainable-and-secure-data-centre-facilities-2023-09-05_en)). These efforts are crucial for aligning with the Net-Zero emissions Scenario by 2050.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[32m## Challenges and Future Directions\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[32mDespite these initiatives, challenges remain. The rapid growth in data centre construction and energy consumption, as observed in the UK and globally, continues to outpace the implementation of carbon-free energy projects ([Google](https://sustainability.google/operating-sustainably/net-zero-carbon/)). This mismatch highlights the need for accelerated efforts in deploying renewable energy solutions and improving energy efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[32mMoreover, the reliance on third-party data centres, or colocation facilities, complicates emissions tracking and accountability. Large tech companies often rent significant portions of their data centre capacity, making it challenging to accurately report and manage emissions ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/sep/15/data-center-gas-emissions-tech)).\n",

      "\u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[32mIn conclusion, while precise figures for CO2 emissions from UK data centres in 2023 are not explicitly available, the data suggests significant contributions to national and global emissions. The ongoing efforts to enhance sustainability and reduce emissions are commendable, yet the challenges of rapid growth and underreporting persist. Achieving climate neutrality by 2030 will require concerted efforts from all stakeholders, including data centre operators, tech companies, and policymakers.\n",

      "Content: (Image credit: ServeTheHome) The recent AI boom has paid dividends for Nvidia, with the company reportedly shipping 3.76 million data center GPUs in 2023 alone. This is over a million more graphics processors than it shipped to this market in 2022, growing its sales by over 42%. According to HPCwire, these numbers show that Nvidia has retained its 98% market share of the data center GPU market in 2023 from the previous year.Aside from its lead in the data center market, Nvidia has also cornered 88% of the desktop GPU market, with the next-generation RTX 50-series expected to arrive later this year. Because of this massive demand, the company has seen record growth, with Nvidia hitting $60.9 billion in revenue in 2023 ‚Äî a full 126% higher than in 2022.We‚Äôve seen this growth despite the U.S. ban on Nvidia‚Äôs exports of AI and other advanced chips to China. Furthermore, the company still had to deal with an AI GPU shortage as TSMC‚Äôs output could not keep pace with demand.Nevertheless,\n",

The market researcher estimates the volume of Nvidia H100 GPUs alone shipped during calendar Q2 added up to more than 900 tons in weight. This headline-grabbing figure comes from the company's latest Cloud and Data Center Market Update, which notes the shift in datacenter investment priorities it previously highlighted continues apace. The report says demand for servers fitted with eight GPUs for AI processing work has had the effect of pushing up average prices, while simultaneously putting the squeeze on investment in other areas. As a consequence, Omdia has once again lowered its estimate for annual server shipments for 2023 by another 1 million\n",

      "\u001b[32m## Shipment Volume Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[32mAccording to multiple reports, Nvidia shipped approximately 1.5 million units of its H100 GPUs in 2023. This figure is derived from various sources, including market research firms and industry analyses. The Financial Times, as cited by [Moomoo](https://www.moomoo.com/community/feed/the-h100-could-generate-at-least-50-billion-in-revenue-111691287625733), initially forecasted that Nvidia would ship 550,000 units. However, a report from Omdia indicated that Nvidia sold half a million units in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 alone, which ended on October 29, 2023. This substantial shipment volume underscores the growing demand for high-performance GPUs in data centers and AI applications.\n",

      "\n",
      "\u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[32mThe shipment of 1.5 million H100 GPUs in 2023 translated into significant revenue for Nvidia. Assuming an average selling price (ASP) of $25,000 per unit, Nvidia generated approximately $37.5 billion in revenue from the H100 processors alone ([Moomoo](https://www.moomoo.com/community/feed/the-h100-could-generate-at-least-50-billion-in-revenue-111691287625733)). This revenue is a testament to the strategic importance of the H100 GPUs in Nvidia's product lineup and their role in the company's financial success.\n",

      "\n",
      "\u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[32mNvidia's dominance in the data center GPU market is evident, with the company retaining a 98% market share in 2023 ([Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/nvidia-shipped-376m-data-center-gpus-in-2023-dominates-business-with-98-revenue-share)). This dominance is further reinforced by Nvidia's control of 88% of the desktop GPU market. The company's strategic focus on AI and data center applications has positioned it as a leader in the industry, with the H100 GPUs playing a crucial role in maintaining this leadership position.\n",

      "\n",
      "\u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[32mDespite Nvidia's strong market position, competition in the GPU market is intensifying. Companies like Intel and AMD are developing alternative solutions, such as Intel's Gaudi 3 AI processor, which is priced competitively against Nvidia's H100 ([Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/nvidia-shipped-376m-data-center-gpus-in-2023-dominates-business-with-98-revenue-share)). Additionally, major tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google are investing in their own chip technologies to reduce reliance on Nvidia. However, Nvidia's GPUs continue to be favored for their superior AI performance and adaptability.\n",

      "\u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[32m## Challenges and Future Outlook\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[32mNvidia faced several challenges in 2023, including a U.S. ban on exports of AI and advanced chips to China and an AI GPU shortage due to TSMC's production constraints ([Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/nvidia-shipped-376m-data-center-gpus-in-2023-dominates-business-with-98-revenue-share)). Despite these challenges, Nvidia achieved record growth, with revenues reaching $60.9 billion in 2023, a 126% increase from 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[32mLooking ahead, Nvidia is expected to continue its strong performance in the GPU market. The company plans to ship 2 million units of the H100 in 2024, potentially generating at least $50 billion in revenue ([Moomoo](https://www.moomoo.com/community/feed/the-h100-could-generate-at-least-50-billion-in-revenue-111691287625733)). This growth is likely to be driven by ongoing demand for AI and data center applications, as well as the introduction of new products like the RTX 50-series.\n",

      "Content: Abstract Background: Reliable information about the prevalence of hypertension in different world regions is essential to the development of national and international health policies for prevention and control of this condition. We aimed to pool data from different regions of the world to estimate the overall prevalence and absolute burden of hypertension in 2000, and to estimate the global burden in 2025. Methods: We searched the published literature from Jan 1, 1980, to Dec 31, 2002, using MEDLINE, supplemented by a manual search of bibliographies of retrieved articles. We included studies that reported sex-specific and age-specific prevalence of hypertension in representative population samples. All data were obtained independently by two investigators with a standardised protocol and data-collection form. Results: Overall, 26.4% (95% CI 26.0-26.8%) of the adult population in 2000 had hypertension (26.6% of men [26.0-27.2%] and 26.1% of women [25.5-26.6%]), and 29.2% (28.8-29.7%)\n",
